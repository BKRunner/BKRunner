- 👋 Hi, I’m @BKRunner
- 👀 I’m interested in making math accessible, meaningful, and fun - and in learning enough programming to create entertaining practice games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of programming in the context of the internet (I'm updating skills developed in the days of "dialing up to the mainframe.")
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Scratch projects I've developed - I'd love to make them more sophisticated and fun!
- 📫 How to reach me seebkrun@gmail.com
